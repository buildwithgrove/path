# shannon_query_services_by_owner queries all services from a Pocket Network Shannon environment
# and filters them to show only services owned by a specific address.
#
# Parameters:
#   $1 (env): Network environment - must be one of: alpha, beta, main
#   $2 (owner_address): The owner address to filter services by
#
# Returns:
#   Outputs a list of services owned by the specified address in the format:
#   "- <service_id>: <service_name>"
#   Services are displayed with colored service IDs (blue)
#
# Side effects:
#   - Writes raw JSON response to /tmp/shannon_all_services_${ENV}.json for debugging
#   - Requires pocketd CLI tool to be installed and configured
#   - Uses ~/.pocket_prod as the home directory for pocketd
#
# Usage:
#   shannon_query_services_by_owner main pokt1lf0kekv9zcv9v3wy4v6jx2wh7v4665s8e0sl9s

# shannon_query_service_tlds_by_id queries all suppliers from a Pocket Network Shannon environment
# and aggregates the 2nd-level TLDs (e.g. 'nodefleet.net') for each service ID.
#
# This function is used in shannon_preliminary_services_test.sh to populate the SERVICE_TLDS
# associative array, which maps service IDs to their comma-separated TLD lists for display
# in the final report table.
#
# Parameters:
#   $1 (env): Network environment - must be one of: alpha, beta, main
#   $2 (structured): Optional "--structured" flag for JSON-only output without log messages
#
# Returns:
#   Without --structured: Human-readable list with colored service IDs showing TLDs per service
#   With --structured: Raw JSON object mapping service IDs to arrays of unique TLDs
#
# Side effects:
#   - Writes raw JSON response to /tmp/shannon_supplier_dump_${ENV}.json for debugging
#   - Requires pocketd CLI tool to be installed and configured
#   - Uses ~/.pocket as the home directory for pocketd
#
# Example JSON output with --structured:
#   {"eth": ["nodefleet.net", "grove.city"], "bsc": ["ankr.com", "quicknode.com"]}
#
# Usage:
#   shannon_query_service_tlds_by_id beta                    # Human-readable output
#   shannon_query_service_tlds_by_id main --structured      # JSON output for parsing
