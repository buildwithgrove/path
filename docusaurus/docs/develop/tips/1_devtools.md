## DevTools

PATH provides developer tools to help diagnose and debug endpoint behavior in real-time.

### Disqualified Endpoints API

The `/disqualified_endpoints` endpoint is a powerful diagnostic tool that provides visibility into why certain endpoints are not being used by PATH for relay requests.

### Quickstart
See the disqualified endpoints of your PATH gateway on base :

```bash
curl http://localhost:3069/disqualified_endpoints \
  -H "Target-Service-Id: base" | jq
```

:::tip ðŸŒ¿ GROVE EMPLOYEES ONLY
To see data on Grove's Portal, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl https://base.rpc.grove.city/disqualified_endpoints | jq
```

_Note: GUARD will assign the service ID from the subdomain to the `Target-Service-Id` header._

:::

#### What is it?

The Disqualified Endpoints API returns a comprehensive list of endpoints that have been temporarily or permanently excluded from serving requests for a given service. This includes:

- **Protocol-level sanctions**: Endpoints sanctioned due to relay errors or poor behavior (managed by Shannon protocol)
- **QoS-level disqualifications**: Endpoints failing quality-of-service checks (managed by EVM QoS service)

#### Why use it?

When developing or debugging PATH integrations, you may notice that certain endpoints aren't receiving traffic. This API helps you understand:

- Which endpoints are currently disqualified and why
- Whether the disqualification is temporary (session-based) or permanent
- Aggregate statistics about endpoint health across your service
- Which suppliers are affected by sanctions

#### How to use it

**Endpoint**: `GET /disqualified_endpoints`

**Required Headers**:
- `Target-Service-Id`: The service ID to query (e.g., `base`, `eth`, `polygon`)

**Example Request**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3069/disqualified_endpoints \
  -H "Target-Service-Id: base" | jq
```

Or use the provided make target:
```bash
make disqualified_endpoints SERVICE_ID=base
```

#### Response Structure

The response from the disqualified endpoints API contains details about endpoints that have been excluded from serving requests.
