:::tip

Easy to use make targets are provided in the [test requests Makefile](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path/blob/main/makefiles/test_requests.mk).

You can run the following commands if you have a local PATH instance running pointing to Pocket Network.

```bash
relay-util \
    -u http://localhost:3070/v1 \
    -H "target-service-id: $${SERVICE_ID:-anvil}" \
    -H "authorization: test_api_key" \
		-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","id":1}' \
		-x 100 \
		-b
```
