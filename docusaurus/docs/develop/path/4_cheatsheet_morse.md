## 0. Prerequisites

1. Prepare your environment by following the instructions in the [**environment setup**](2_environment.md) guide.
2. Install the [**pocket CLI**](https://github.com/pokt-network/homebrew-pocket-core): CLI for interacting with Pocket's Morse Network

:::tip
You can use the `make install_deps` command to install the dependencies for the PATH stack, **excluding** the Pocket CLI.
:::

## 1. Setup Morse Protocol Accounts

:::danger THIS SECTION IS OPTIONAL - README!

If you are setting up PATH on Morse, you can most likely **SKIP THIS SECTION**.

If you don't know your AATs, you should know whom to reach out to on the team.

:::

`Application Authentication Tokens` (**AATs**) are auth tokens that allow application
clients to access the network without the need to expose their private keys.
Once you have one or more valid AATs, you can populate the configuration files required to run the full `PATH Gateway` instance.

The following resources are also good references and starting points:

- [What are AATs?](https://docs.pokt.network/gateways/host-a-gateway/relay-process#what-are-aats)
- [Host a Gateway on Morse](https://docs.pokt.network/gateways/host-a-gateway)
- [pocket-core/doc/specs/application-auth-token.md](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket-core/blob/7f936ff7353249b161854e24435e4bc32d47aa3f/doc/specs/application-auth-token.md)
- [pocket-core/doc/specs/cli/apps.md](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket-core/blob/7f936ff7353249b161854e24435e4bc32d47aa3f/doc/specs/cli/apps.md)

### 1.1 AAT Generation

We **strongly** recommend following the resources above.

However, assuming you have have worked with Morse in the past and have access to a **staked application**,
you can follow the instructions below.

<details>

<summary>tl;dr Use at your own risk copy-pasta commands</summary>

**Get the source code:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:pokt-network/pocket-core.git
cd pocket-core
```

**Build your own `pocket-core` binary:**

```bash
go build -o pocket ./app/cmd/pocket_core/main.go
```

**Generate an AAT:**

```bash
./pocket-core create-aat <ADDR_APP> <CLIENT_PUB>
```

**Take note of the output:**

```json
{
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "app_pub_key": <APP_PUB>,
  "client_pub_key": <CLIENT_PUB>,
  "signature": <APP_SIG>
}
```

**So you can prepare a configuration like so:**

```yaml
morse_config:
  # ...
  relay_signing_key: "CLIENT_PRIV"
  # ...
signed_aats:
  <ADDR_APP>:
    client_public_key: "<CLIENT_PUB>"
    application_public_key: "<APP_PUB>"
    application_signature: "<APP_SIG>"
```

</details>

## 2. Configure PATH

### 2.1 Generate Morse Config

Run the following commands to generate a Morse config at `local/path/.config.yaml`:

```bash
# Generate ./e2e/.morse.config.yaml
make morse_prepare_e2e_config

# Copy to ./local/path/.config.yaml
make morse_copy_e2e_config_to_local

# IMPORTANT: In the next, step, update ./local/path/.config.yaml
```

### 2.2 Verify Configuration

You'll need to manually update these fields in the config file:

- **`url`** - A URL to a full Morse node (e.g. `https://pocket-rpc.liquify.com"`)
- **`relay_signing_key`** - The private ed25519 key associated with `CLIENT_PRIV` when you ran `pocket-core create-aat <ADDR_APP> <CLIENT_PUB>` above
- **`signed_aats`** - The output of `pocket-core create-aat ...` above

Check your updated config:

```bash
cat ./local/path/.config.yaml
```

It should look similar to the following with the required fields filled out:

```yaml
morse_config:
  # Your Morse configuration
  url: "your-morse-endpoint-url"
  relay_signing_key: "CLIENT_PRIV"
  # ... other Morse specific configs
signed_aats:
  <ADDR_APP>:
    client_public_key: "<CLIENT_PUB>"
    application_public_key: "<APP_PUB>"
    application_signature: "<APP_SIG>"
```

:::important Configuration Validation
Do a manual sanity check of the configuration to ensure everything looks correct before continuing.
:::

:::tip Grove Employees

If you are an employee of Grove, look for `PATH - Morse - Test - E2E Config` in 1Password and use that file here.

:::

## 3. Run PATH in development mode

### 3.1 Start PATH

Run PATH in local development mode in Tilt by running:

```bash
make path_up
```

You can stop PATH stack by running:

```bash
make path_down
```

### 3.2 Monitor PATH

:::warning Grab a â˜•

It could take a few minutes for the PATH stack to start up the first time.

:::

You should see an output similar to the following relatively quickly (~30 seconds):

![Tilt Dashboard](../../../static/img/path-in-tilt-console.png)

Once you see the above log, you may visit [localhost:10350](<http://localhost:10350/r/(all)/overview>) to view the Tilt dashboard.

## 4. Test Relays

:::warning Anvil Node & Request Retries

_tl;dr Retry the requests below if the first one fails._

The instructions above were written to get you to access an `F00C` (Ethereum MainNet) node accessible on Pocket Network.

Since `F00C` requires a production onchain stake, there is a chance it may not be available.

We recommend you try the instructions below a few times to ensure you can get a successful relay. Otherwise, reach out to the community on Discord.

:::

### Test Relay with `curl`

```bash
curl http://localhost:3070/v1 \
  -H "Target-Service-Id: F00C" \
  -H "Authorization: test_api_key" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "eth_blockNumber" }'
```

And you should expect to see a response similar to the following:

```json
{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0x2f01a"}%
```

### Test Relay with `make`

For your convenience, we have provided makefile helpers to test relays with `curl` and `jq`.
You can find these in the `makefiles/test_requests.mk` file.

For example, to mimic the `curl` command above, you can simply run:

:::warning Request Retries
If requests fail, retry a few times as you may hit unresponsive nodes.
:::

```bash
make test_request__morse_service_id_header
```

To see all available helpers, run:

```bash
make help
```

### Load Testing with `relay-util`

You can use the `relay-util` tool to load test your relays.

The following will send 100 requests to the `F00C` node and give you performance metrics.

```bash
make test_request__shannon_relay_util_100
```

:::note TODO: Screenshots

Add a screenshot of the output.

## Additional Notes

- The Morse protocol setup process is more manual than Shannon
- Pay close attention to field names in configuration files
- Keep your configuration secure as it contains sensitive information
- For troubleshooting, consult the [Gateway Server Kit instructions](https://github.com/pokt-network/gateway-server/blob/main/docs/quick-onboarding-guide.md#5-insert-app-stake-private-keys)
