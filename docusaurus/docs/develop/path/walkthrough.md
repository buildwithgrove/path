:::danger DOCUMENTATION IN FLUX
	
**ü¶ñ This documentation is out of date as of [PATH PR #176](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path/pull/176).**

TODO_DOCUMENT(@commoddity): A full revamp of these docs to capture improvements to PATH's GUARD auth functionality is underway and will be available soon.

## Introduction <!-- omit in toc -->

This walkthrough assumes you have gone through [environment setup](./env_setup.md)
and have gotten either a [Shannon](./cheat_sheet_shannon.md) or [Morse](./cheat_sheet_morse.md)
gateway running.

It dives deeper into how to develop on PATH, run E2E tests, etc...

## Running PATH

PATH offers two deployment modes for local development:

### 1. Tilt Mode (Recommended)

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://docs.tilt.dev/">
    <img src="https://blog.tilt.dev/assets/img/blog-default-preview.png" alt="Tilt logo" width="200"/>
  <p><b>Tilt Documentation</b></p>
  </a>
</div>

Runs PATH with full functionality in a local Kubernetes cluster:

- Routes through Envoy Proxy (port `3070`)
- Enables authorization, rate limiting, and service aliasing
- Uses configs from `/local` directory with Kind + Tilt

Review these configurations:

- [**Tiltfile**](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path/tree/main/Tiltfile): Tiltfile config file in the PATH repository
- [**Values file**](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path/tree/main/local/path/config/path-values.yaml): Values file for the local cluster in the PATH repository

### 2. Standalone Binary Mode

Runs PATH without Envoy Proxy for simpler setup:

- Connects directly to PATH Service (port `3069`)
- Disables authorization, rate limiting, and service aliasing
- Launches the binary directly without additional services, tools or kubernetes cluster

## 2. Protocol Configuration

:::warning Grove Employee Only (Sensitive Information)

Search for `PATH` in **1Password** for a ready to use copy-pasta config file for
both Morse and Shannon.

:::

### 2.1 Shannon Protocol Configs

See the [Shannon Cheat Sheet](./cheat_sheet_shannon.md) and [PATH Config Docs](./path_config.md)
for details on configuring a Shannon gateway.

If you are comfortable updating the config file manually, then:

```sh
# Create ./e2e/.shannon.config.yaml
make prepare_shannon_e2e_config
# Update it manually

# Copy it to ./local/path/.config.yaml
make copy_shannon_e2e_config_to_local
```

### 2.2 Morse Protocol Configs

See the [Morse Cheat Sheet](./cheat_sheet_morse.md) and [PATH Config Docs](./path_config.md)
for details on configuring a Morse gateway.

If you are comfortable updating the config file manually, then:

```sh
# Create ./e2e/.morse.config.yaml
make prepare_morse_e2e_config
# Update it manually

# Copy it to ./local/path/.config.yaml
make copy_morse_config_to_local
```

## 3. Envoy Proxy Configuration

See the [Envoy Walkthrough](./../envoy/walkthrough.md) for all the details
on running and configuring Envoy.

To get up and running quickly, run:

```sh
make init_envoy
```

**We recommend choosing Option 2 (no authorization) for now as a simpler starting point.**

If you wish to use an `0Auth` provider _([for example Auth0](https://auth0.com))_ to enable
authorizing requests using an issued JWT, you will need to provide the `AUTH_DOMAIN` and
`AUTH_AUDIENCE` values to substitute the sensitive variables in the `envoy.yaml` file.

If you do not wish to use an OAuth provider, simply answer `no` when prompted.
This will allow authorizing requests with a static API key only.

### 3.1 Configuring Relay Authorization

:::tip

Saving `.gateway-endpoints.yaml` will automatically stream the updated file contents to PADS (PATH Auth Data Server) in Tilt; there is no need to restart PADS.

:::

You can view the `GatewayEndpoint`s and update `local/path/envoy/.gateway-endpoints.yaml` to configure authorization for your relays.

- `endpoint_1_static_key` requires an API key in the `authorization` header set to `api_key_1` by default.
- `endpoint_3_no_auth` does not require an API key in the `authorization` header.

For detailed information on the `GatewayEndpoint` data structure, including how to use a Postgres database for storing `GatewayEndpoints`, see the PATH Auth Data Server section of the [PATH Config Docs](path_config.md).

## 4. Run the `PATH` Gateway

Once your configs are in place, simply run one of the following commands:

```sh
# Tilt Mode
make path_up

# Standalone Binary Mode
make path_run
```

### 4.1 View `PATH` Resources in Tilt

Regardless of which mode you choose, you should see the output below and can
visit [localhost:10350](<http://localhost:10350/r/(all)/overview>) in your browser
to view the Tilt dashboard.

```bash
‚ùØ make path_up
#########################################################################
### ./local/path/.config.yaml already exists, not overwriting. ###
#########################################################################
No kind clusters found.
Cluster 'path-localnet' not found. Creating it...
Creating cluster "path-localnet" ...
# ...
Set kubectl context to "kind-path-localnet"
You can now use your cluster with:
# ...
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-path-localnet
# ...
(space) to open the browser
(s) to stream logs (--stream=true)
(t) to open legacy terminal mode (--legacy=true)
(ctrl-c) to exit
```

### 4.2 Wait for the `PATH` stack to initialize

The `PATH Gateway` stack may take a minute or more to initialize the first time
you run it as it must download all required Docker images.

You will be able to tell it is ready when you see log output like this in the
[`path`](http://localhost:10350/r/path/overview) resource in the Tilt dashboard:

```json
{"level":"info","message":"Starting PATH using config file: /app/config/.config.yaml"}
{"level":"info","message":"Starting PATH gateway with Shannon protocol"}
{"level":"info","message":"Starting the cache update process."}
{"level":"info","package":"router","message":"PATH gateway running on port 3069"}
{"level":"info","services count":1,"message":"Running Hydrator"}
```

## 5. Send a Relay

You can verify that servicing relays works by sending one yourself!

:::warning

Requests MAY hit unresponsive nodes. If that happens, keep retrying the request a few times.

Once `PATH`s QoS module is mature, this will be handled automatically.

:::

### 5.1 Envoy Proxy Mode with Static Key Authorization

Authorized relays are routed through Envoy Proxy running on port `3070`.

This endpoint requires an API key in the `authorization` header.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3070/v1/endpoint_1_static_key \
    -X POST \
    -H "authorization: api_key_1" \
    -H "target-service-id: anvil" \
    -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "eth_blockNumber" }'
```

### 5.2 Envoy Proxy without any Authorization

Authorized relays are routed through Envoy Proxy running on port `3070`.

This endpoint does not require an API key in the `authorization` header.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3070/v1/endpoint_3_no_auth \
    -X POST \
    -H "target-service-id: anvil" \
    -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "eth_blockNumber" }'
```

### 5.3 Standalone mode without any Authorization

Unauthorized relays are routed directly to the `PATH` Service, running on `port 3069`.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3069/v1/ \
    -X POST \
    -H "target-service-id: anvil" \
    -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "eth_blockNumber" }'
```

## E2E Tests

Assuming you prepared `./e2e/.morse.config.yaml` and `./e2e/.shannon.config.yaml`
following the instructions above, you can run the E2E tests like so:

```sh
# Run E2E tests against Shannon Beta Testnet
make test_e2e_shannon_relay

# Run E2E tests against Morse MainNet
make test_e2e_morse_relay

# Run all tests
make test_all
```
