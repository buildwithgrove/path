## PATH Images

PATH releases provide a Docker image to quickly bootstrap your Path gateway without building your own image.

### PATH Resources

- [**Container Registry**](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path/pkgs/container/path): Find all PATH Docker images
- [**Releases**](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path/releases): Find the latest release and release notes
- [**Package Versions**](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path/pkgs/container/path/versions): Find all available versions of the PATH Docker image

### Example Usage

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/buildwithgrove/path
```
