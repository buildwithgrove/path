## Overview

**PATH (Path API & Toolkit Harness)** is an open source framework to enable access
to a permissionless network of API providers of open source services and data
sources without sacrificing enterprise-grade SLAs.

It provides all the necessary tools for you to deploy your own API Gateway without
needing to maintain the backend services.

An easy way to think about **PATH** and **Pocket Network** is:

- **Pocket Network** is a permissionless network of API providers for open source services and data sources
- **PATH** is a framework to build a Gateway that ensures high quality of service atop of Pocket Network

## Where do I get started?

To get started, allocate 1-3 hours of time and start with the [PATH Getting Started](develop/path/1_getting_started.md).

It will go through all the details of how PATH works, how to configure it, and how to run it locally.

## TODO

This documentation is an active work in progress and there's a lot more we want to add:

- [ ] Video tutorial walkthrough
- [ ] Deployment instructions
- [ ] Billing integrations
- [ ] ETL Pipelines
- [ ] [Add your request here](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path/issues/new/choose)

## Is PATH for me?

If you're a Web2 Gateway Provider, you have four modes of operation to choose from:

1. **Dependent (Step Aside)**: Let clients use [Grove's Portal](https://portal.grove.city/) directly. For example, if you do not provide the services the customer is looking for.

2. **Grove Hybrid (Frontend)**: Provide a custom front-end experience and build your own gateway infrastructure but leverage [Grove's Portal API](https://docs.grove.city/) behind the **scenes**. For example, if you want want to build your own business logic around quality-of-service, load balancing, authentication as well as building your own front-end.

3. **PATH Hybrid (Full Stack):** Use `PATH` so you can provide the client with a customized end-to-end experience but also settle traffic on `Pocket Network` yourself without relying on `Grove`'s infrastructure at all.

4. **Independent (On Your Own):** Use your own stack to settle traffic on your own infrastructure, independent of `Grove`, `PATH` or `Pocket Network`.

Here's the information reorganized into a table and nodes section:

### Implementation Mode Comparison

If you're a Web2 Gateway Provider, you can use this table to understand you preferable mode of operation:

<!-- TODO_IMPROVE(@olshansk):

- Document the use case where the Gateway uses the network as a primary infra provider w/ their own infra as backup
- Document the use cases where the Gateway uses the network as a backup infra provider w/ their own infra as primary
- Write about the insurance analogy
