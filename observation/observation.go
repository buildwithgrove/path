// package observation defines all the structures used to communicate all aspects of an observation by each component of PATH.
// This includes, but is not limited to observations of:
// 1. HTTP service requests: e.g. the length of the HTTP request's payload.
// 2. Protocol-level observations: e.g. an endpoint's response indicating it is maxed-out for an app.
// 3. QoS-level observations: e.g. Solana blockchain Epoch reported by an endpoint.
