services:
  # "anvil" is a test service alias used in the Shannon E2E tests.
  # If this config is used for Shannon E2E tests, do not remove or change this service.
  # This is used for testing a dedicated Ethereum endpoint that is not of any public network.
  # Note that this service has no alias, meaning it can be reached only by its service ID.
  # eg. https://anvil.path.grove.city
  "anvil": {}

  # "F00C" is the service ID for the Ethereum MainNet Archival.
  # Note that this service has an alias, meaning it can be reached
  # both by its service ID and by its alias.
  # eg. https://F00C.path.grove.city and https://eth.path.grove.city.
  "F00C":
    alias: "eth"

# To enable endpoint hydrator to run QoS checks against 
# service endpoints, add the following to the config:
# hydrator_config:
#   service_ids:
#     - "anvil"
#     - "F00C"
