# This script patches the Envoy Gateway LoadBalancer service to expose a static port (30070) inside the container.
# This allows Envoy Gateway to be reachable from the local machine on port 3070, as defined in the `kind-config.yaml` file.
#
# Context:
# - The Envoy Gateway service is created as a LoadBalancer which, when running in kind, automatically
#   uses a NodePort under the covers. 
# - In a real cloud environment, the LoadBalancer provisioner would map a public IP to this NodePort. 
# - In `kind`, since there's no external load balancer, Kubernetes auto-assigns a dynamic NodePort 
#   (within the 30000â€“32767 range) if one is not explicitly specified.
