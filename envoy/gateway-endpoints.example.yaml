# TODO_IMPROVE(@commoddity): Update schema URL to point to main branch once `yaml-data-source` branch is merged into main.
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildwithgrove/path-auth-data-server/refs/heads/yaml-data-source/yaml/gateway-endpoints.schema.yaml

# The above schema URL may be used to validate this file using the `yaml-language-server` VSCode extension.
# See: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml

# This file shows examples of how to configure PATH gateway endpoints using a YAML file as the PADS data source.
# These files will be converted to the proto.GatewayEndpoint struct expected by the PATH's Go External Auth Server.
# 
# For details on the expected proto format, see the definition in 
# envoy/auth_server/proto/gateway_endpoint.proto
endpoints:

  # 1. Example of a gateway endpoint using API Key Authorization
  # This endpoint has no rate limits defined (the rate_limiting field is omitted entirely in this case).
